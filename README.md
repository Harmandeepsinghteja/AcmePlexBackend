# Movie Theater Ticket Reservation App

## Project Overview
The Movie Theater Ticket Reservation App is designed for AcmePlex, a company with multiple theaters, to facilitate ticket reservations for movie screenings. This application supports two types of users: Ordinary Users and Registered Users (RUs). Ordinary users can search for movies, select theaters, view available showtimes, choose seats, make payments, and receive tickets via email. They can cancel tickets up to 72 hours before the show with a 15% administration fee. RUs pay an annual fee but are exempt from cancellation fees and have early access to movie announcements.
